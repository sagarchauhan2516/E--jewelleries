Since you prefer free or low-cost tools, here’s the best approach for learning AR for your **E-Jewellery shop** project:  

### **Free Alternatives to Paid Tools**  
✅ **Instead of 8thWall** → Use **WebXR + Three.js** (completely free, but requires more coding).  
✅ **Instead of Paid WebAR SDKs** → Use **MindAR** (good for marker-based AR, free & open-source).  
✅ **For Face & Hand Tracking** → Use **MediaPipe (by Google)** (free & works well for jewellery try-on).
